#Git Katas

Katas are (usually) short exercises meant for training. If done repeatedly, they should reinforce certain skills or ideas. These katas are meant to create a higher level of familiarity with Git. Right now these cover only the very basics of Git.

If you are doing this for an assignment, do each assigned kata in a new repository. If you don't want to litter your public Github repository with a bunch of little repositories, feel free to create an organization on GitHub for the class to keep these in.
